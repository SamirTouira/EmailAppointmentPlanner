# EmailAppointmentPlanner
This is a simple email appointment scheduler that makes things easier for you. Why?

You just need to call the PHP file when a form is submitted.

The script then offers the appointment from the form to the recipient, who can accept, decline, or refuse. It also offers another appointment via an internal form, which can be accepted or declined, all via email.

Coming soon!
